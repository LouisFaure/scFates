scFates - a suite for advanced pseudotime analysis
==================================================

**scFates** is a scalable Python suite for tree inference and advanced pseudotime analysis.

It initially is a translation from crestree_, a R package developed for the analysis of neural crest fates during
murine embryonic development (`Soldatov et al., Science, 2019 <https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aas9536>`_), and used
in another study of neural crest derived sensory neurons (`Faure et al., Nature Communications, 2020 <https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-17929-4>`_).

The initial R version included a tree inference approach inspired from SimplePPT, this version now adds the choice of using ElPiGraph_,
another method for principal graph learning (`Albergante et al., Entropy, 2020 <https://doi.org/10.3390/e22030296>`_).
scFates is fully compatible with scanpy_, and contains GPU-accelerated functions for faster and scalable inference.

Analysis key steps
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- learn a principal tree on the space of your choice (gene expression, PCA, diffusion, ...).
- obtain a pseudotime value upon selection of a root (or two roots).
- test and fit features significantly changing along the tree, cluster them.
- perform differential expression between branches.
- identify branch-specific early activating features and probe their correlations prior to bifurcation.
